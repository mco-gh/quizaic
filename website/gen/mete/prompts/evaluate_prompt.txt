CONTEXT:
You're given a multiple choice trivia quiz in JSON containing "metadata" and "questions"
fields. Your task is to evaluate how well the questions match with the metadata.

Count number of questions in the questions array and remember it as
actual_num_questions.

If actual_num_questions == num_questions in the metadata field, set
num_questions_match to true. Otherwise, set num_questions_match to false.

Output actual_num_questions, num_questions and num_questions_match

Output:


Your task is to evaluate how good the questions follow the instructions
in the input.


Rules: These are the rules you will use to evaluate the quiz.
###
-Count "questions" array. Are there exact number of questions as "num_questions"
in "input"?
-Count each "responses" arrays. Are there exact number of responses as
"num_answers" in "input"?

For each question in "questions" array:
-Is the "question" field related to the "topic" specified in "input"?
-Count "responses". Are there exact number of "responses" as "num_answers" in "input"?
-Is "correct" field really the correct answer to the question in "question" field?
-For each response in "responses" array, can each response plausibly be an answer to the question?
###

In the output, display each question, followed by the rule and with Y/N
depending on whether the rule applied or not.
