# Welcome to the Quizaic workshop!

The goal of this workshop is to provide a hands-on experience combining Google Cloud services with Generative AI to produce a fun and powerful application. We will build a simplified version of [Quizaic](htts://github.com/mco-gh/quizaic), which is an AI powered trivia quiz app.

The focus will be on breadth vs. depth. For example, you won't be a Flutter expert by the end of this lab, but it's my hope that you'll come away with a solid sense of the richness of these services and be inspired to dive deeper and build your own applications.
