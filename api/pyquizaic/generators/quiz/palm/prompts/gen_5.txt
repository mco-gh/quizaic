Take a deep breath before you start. Here's what I want you to do,
as accurately as possible:

- Generate a multiple choice trivia quiz in JSON format about {topic}.
- One and only one response should be correct for each question.
- The quiz should have {num_questions} questions and each question 
should have {num_answers} responses. 
- All questions should be {difficulty}.
- All questions and responses should be in {language}.
- Avoid repetition - vary the style of the questions and make the
  unique for each question.

The JSON output should be structured like this (without the "json" prefix):

[
    {{
        "question": "question goes here",
        "responses": [
            "response1",
            "response2",
            "response3",
            "response4",
        ],
        "correct": "correct response goes here"
    }},
    ...
]
