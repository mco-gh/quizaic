Generate a multiple choice trivia quiz in JSON format about {topic}.
The quiz should have {num_questions} questions and each question 
should have {num_answers} responses. 
Vary the style of the questions and make the response set different
for each question.

The JSON output should be structured like this (without the JSON prefix):

[
    {{
        "question": "question goes here",
        "responses": [
            "response1",
            "response2",
            "response3",
            "response4",
        ],
        "correct": "correct response goes here"
    }},
    ...
]
